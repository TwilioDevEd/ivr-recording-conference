# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  agents = Agent.create([{ extension: 'Brodo', phone_number: "+12066505813" }, { extension: 'Dugobah', phone_number: "+12066505813" }, { extension: '113', phone_number: "+12066505813" }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
